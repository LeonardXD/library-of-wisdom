# A Brief History of Git

1. **Git saves every version of the code**  
   Git keeps a full history of every change made to a project. Each saved change is called a *commit*, and users can go back to older versions whenever they want. If something goes wrong, they can return to a working version, which makes coding much safer for programmers.

2. **Git helps people work together**  
   Many people can work on the same project at the same time, and Git tracks who changed each part of the code. It helps prevent people from overwriting each other’s work. When conflicts happen, Git shows what needs fixing, which makes teamwork easier.

3. **Git runs on your computer**  
   Git works locally on a user’s own machine, so the internet is not needed to save changes. Users can create commits and branches offline, and the project history stays on the computer. The internet is only needed when sharing code with others.
