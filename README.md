## Mission Statement 📜

The mission of the Library of Wisdom is to create a thoughtful, accessible digital space that preserves and 
shares meaningful knowledge, ideas, and written works. By curating diverse perspectives across authors, 
histories, and collections, the project encourages learning, reflection, and intellectual curiosity. 
The Library of Wisdom is not just a repository of information, but a living archive that invites exploration, 
contribution, and the responsible exchange of ideas for the benefit of all learners.
